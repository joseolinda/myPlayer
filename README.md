## Before start

This is a version of the music player developed by [pooya2293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTHRWGn_sJw) and inspired by the visual project of [Moh Yusril Firmansyah](https://dribbble.com/shots/20137433-Music-Player-App). This project uses NPM to manage "FontAwesome" dependencies and "Gulp" to automate the use of "SASS". You need to have **NodeJS** installed and **NPM** in the **PATH** to install dependencies.

**This project was and should be used for learning purposes only**.
